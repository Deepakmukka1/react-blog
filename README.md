### Problems encountered
1. Almost fixed all the resposiveness issues, but finally understood the tailwind responisiveness utility classes
2. The main problem i encountered is with the API, i chosen the wrong API (reason is the API works fine in local host but after deploying in gh-pages, i realized it blocks the users who dont have enterprise plan ) so finally found alternate API
